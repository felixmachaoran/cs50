# Week 1: C
## Introduction
- Machine only understand `0`and `1` which called machine code.
- Write source code and convert to machine code by compiler.
## Functions
- Argument (input) passed to functions then we have the return value
- The statement of code ends with a `;`
- The character `\` is called escape character tells compiler the following is a special instruction. <br> E.g. `\n` -- new line
- `#include <stdio.h>` tells the compiler to use library `stdio.h` which is a header file.
