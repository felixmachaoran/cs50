# Week 1: C
## Introduction
- Machine only understand `0`and `1` which called machine code.
- Write source code and convert to machine code by compiler.
## Functions
- Argument(input) passed to functions, then we have the return value(output)<br> **argument -> function -> return value**

## C
- use three commands below to write, complie, and run the code
```
code hello.c

make hello

./hello
```
- in the text editor of C programming
```C
# include <stdio.h>
# include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    string answer = get_string("What's your name?");
    printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
}
```
- The statement of code ends with a `;`
- The character `\` is called escape character tells compiler the following is a special instruction. <br> E.g. `\n` is start new line
- `#include <stdio.h>` tells the compiler to use library `stdio.h` which is a header file.
- quotation marks for string is double quotation, for character is single quotation mark
### Format code with `printf`
- `%s`, string
- `%i`, int
- `%c`, char, only 1 character
- `%f`, double/float
- `%li`, long
### Conditions in C
```C
if (x < y)
{
    printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else if (x > y)
{
    printf("x is greater than y\n");
} 
else
{
    printf("x is equal to y\n");
}
```
- `==` represents *equal*
- `||` represents *or*
### Loops
- While loop
```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 3)
{
    printf("meow\n");
    i++;
}
```
- When we counting, starts with 0 will save the memory ane is best

- For loop: in for loop, we need initialize parameter, set condition, things to do
```C
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}
```
### Define your own function
- define the function name meow
```C
void meow(int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("meow\n");
    }
}
```
- We can put the function at the end, but add `void meow(int n);` just after the header

## Command lines 
- `mv old_file_name new_file_name` this rename the file, remember to take the extension
- `ls` list all files in the server
- `rm file_name` remove the file, with extension
- `cp file_name` copy
- `cd` change directory
- `mkdir` make directory
- `rmdir` remove directory
## Integer Overflow and Type casting
- integer +-*/ integer can only get integer
- use float to get decimal places
- use type casting to do integer math but get result of float
- Computer has limited memory, so the precise is limited
