# Week 0: CS fundamentals
## What is computer science?
- Computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output, thus solving a problem.
- Computers count using a system called binary. A binary digit is called bit, which is `1` (on) or `0` (off).
- 1 byte = 8 bits (255 maximum in 1 byte)
- 111 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 4+2+1 = 7
## ASCII
- ASCII standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
- 255 characters are limited to be represented by ASCII.
## Unicode
- Unicode standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computer(include special characters and emojis)
## More binary representations
- RGB: combination of 3 numbers represents red, green, blue.
- Image: collection of RGB values.
- Video: sequences of many images stored together.
- Music: MIDI data.
## Algorithm
- Different approaches to solve problem with computer.
- The speed of the algorithm is called *big-O* notation (`O^n`, `O^0.5n`, `O^logn`)
## Pseudocode
- Pseudocode is human-readable version of the code.
- Why this is important?
    - Let you think the logic of problem in advance.
    - Provide info to others to understand the code and how it works.
